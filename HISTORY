  provide a schedule (reported by fnu@vdrportal)

  copy EPG to channels with same name but different ID

  Thanks to Udo Richter for his po218n.pl backward compatibility script

2006-09-25: Version 0.0.2

- Fixed segfault when svdrpservice plugin encountered a problem while syncing
  (reported by greenman@vdrportal)
